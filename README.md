### Visualize the data: Graph some (any 3) interesting metrics, maps, or trends from the dataset.
Three graphs were provided. This was done using the Python package PANDAS to parse and generate the data sets/graphs. 

### Price estimation: Given the geo-location (latitude and longitude) of a new property, estimate the weekly average income the homeowner can make with Airbnb.
This was done using TensorFlow to create a multivariable equation for price estimates given a location.

### Bookings optimization: Given the geo-location (latitude and longitude) of a property, what is the ideal price per night that will yield maximum bookings or revenue?
This was done by subtracting a set amount of money from the price estimation. The logic was that if you undercut your competition by a certain amount, your listings will be more popular among consumers.

### Animate: Add an animation to your visualization.
The carousel provides an animation between the highlights of the webpage. It takes a few seconds for the animation to show.

### Investment: If I have $100 million to invest, where in San Francisco should I buy properties so I can maximize my returns with Airbnb? When will I break even?
Calculated based on which location provides the most money per night.

### Popularity: Can you identify the neighborhood that averages the most positive reviews?
This was done using NLTK and its sentiment analysis.
